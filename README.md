### Practice 01 - 3D Text

[Click here to explore the project!](https://jeheecheon.github.io/threejs-journey/practice-01-3d-text)

- Used helvetica font in typeface format to generate a simple 3d text.
- Utilized built-in controlers (Orbit) to move around the space.
- Created a hundred donut-like objects around the text to make it just look better...

It's my first ever 3D project I made during the course
